# miniz

This is miniz 1.5 rel 4 (commit [28f5066e332590c8a68fa4870e89233e72ce7a44](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz/commit/28f5066e332590c8a68fa4870e89233e72ce7a44)), which is (to the best of my knowledge) the last public domain version.

Development continues at [richgel999/miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) under the MIT license.

But for those who want public domain licensed code, here it is.

Note the public domain version is missing various improvements, most importantly ZIP64 support.

Note I didn't write any of this code, all I wrote was this README (which I also place in the public domain)

All credit is due to the original author Rich Geldreich.
